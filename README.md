# Note
This is a small [pomodoro](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com) shell utility. I wrote it for my own personal use and so:
- Yes, it is ugly
- Yes, it is way too simple
- Yes, it could be written in a more efficient and concise way

but... it doesn't matter: I needed something quick and dirty to get things done.
I hate the idea of having to download an app to do such a simple thing.

I pushed it here in order to have it available whenever I move from one pc to another.

# If you really want to use it
First of all: why? By the way, simply open a shell and call:
- `python pomodoro.py` => It will do 4 rounds of 25 minutes, with a five-minute break after each round
- `python pomodoro.py <focus_time> <relax_time>` => it will do 4 round of <focus_time> minutes, with a break of <relax_time> minutes after each round

You cannot pause it, you cannot add a task list and so on... I have already said that: it is extremely simple
